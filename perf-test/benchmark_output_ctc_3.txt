[NeMo W 2025-12-25 22:56:44 nemo_logging:405] The following configuration keys are ignored by Lhotse dataloader: use_start_end_token
[NeMo W 2025-12-25 22:56:44 nemo_logging:405] You are using a non-tarred dataset and requested tokenization during data sampling (pretokenize=True). This will cause the tokenization to happen in the main (GPU) process,possibly impacting the training speed if your tokenizer is very large.If the impact is noticable, set pretokenize=False in dataloader config.(note: that will disable token-per-second filtering and 2D bucketing features)

Transcribing: 0it [00:00, ?it/s][NeMo W 2025-12-25 22:56:47 nemo_logging:405] CTC decoding strategy 'greedy' is slower than 'greedy_batch', which implements the same exact interface. Consider changing your strategy to 'greedy_batch' for a free performance improvement.

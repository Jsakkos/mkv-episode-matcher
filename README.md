Automatically match and rename your MKV TV episodes using The Movie Database (TMDb).

## Features

- üéØ **Automatic Episode Matching**: Uses TMDb and OpenSubtitles to accurately identify episodes
- üîä **Speech Recognition**: Uses OpenAI Whisper for accurate episode identification
- ‚¨áÔ∏è **Subtitle Downloads**: Integration with OpenSubtitles
- ‚ú® **Bulk Processing**: Handle entire seasons at once
- üß™ **Dry Run Mode**: Test changes before applying

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.9-3.12
- [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) installed and available in system PATH
- TMDb API key (optional, for subtitle downloads)
- OpenSubtitles account (optional, for subtitle downloads)

## Quick Start

1. Install the package:
```bash
pip install -U mkv-episode-matcher
```
2. Run onboarding to set up your configuration (first-time users or to update credentials):
```bash
mkv-match --onboard
```
   - You will be prompted for:
     - TMDb API key (for episode matching)
     - OpenSubtitles API key, Consumer Name, Username, and Password (for subtitle downloads)
     - Show Directory (main directory of your show)
   - If a config value already exists, you can accept the default or enter a new value.

3. 
   a. If you setup the TMDb and Opensubtitles credentials above, automatically fetch subtitles with the `--get-subs` flag. 
   b. Alternatively, manually download .srt subtitles files to ~/.mkv-episode-matcher/cache/data/Show Name/

4. Run on your show directory:
```bash
mkv-match --show-dir "path/to/your/show"
```

## Onboarding & Configuration

The onboarding process will prompt you for all required configuration values if you run with `--onboard` or if no config file exists. You can re-run onboarding at any time to update your credentials or show directory.

**Required information:**
- TMDb API key (for episode matching)
- OpenSubtitles API key (for subtitle downloads)
- OpenSubtitles Consumer Name (for subtitle downloads)
- OpenSubtitles Username (for subtitle downloads)
- OpenSubtitles Password (for subtitle downloads)
- Show Directory (main directory of your show)

If a value already exists, it will be shown as the default and you can accept it or enter a new value.

## Directory Structure

MKV Episode Matcher expects your TV shows to be organized as follows:

```
Show Name/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Season 1/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ episode1.mkv
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ episode2.mkv
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Season 2/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ episode1.mkv
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ episode2.mkv
```

## Reference Subtitle File Structure

Subtitle files that are not automatically downloaded using the `--get-subs` flag should be named as follows:

```

~/.mkv-episode-matcher/cache/data/Show Name/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Show Name - S01E01.srt
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Show Name - S01E02.srt
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
```

On Windows, the cache directory is located at `C:\Users\{username}\.mkv-episode-matcher\cache\data\`

Reference subtitle files should follow this naming pattern:
`{show_name} - S{season:02d}E{episode:02d}.srt`

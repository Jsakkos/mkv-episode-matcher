Automatically match and rename your MKV TV episodes using The Movie Database (TMDb).

## Features

- 🎯 **Automatic Episode Matching**: Uses TMDb to accurately identify episodes
- 📝 **Subtitle Extraction**: Extracts subtitles from MKV files
- 🔍 **OCR Support**: Handles image-based subtitles
- 🚀 **Multi-threaded**: Fast processing of multiple files
- ⬇️ **Subtitle Downloads**: Integration with OpenSubtitles
- ✨ **Bulk Processing**: Handle entire seasons at once
- 🧪 **Dry Run Mode**: Test changes before applying

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.9 or higher
- [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) installed and available in system PATH
- [Tesseract OCR](https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki) installed (required for image-based subtitle processing)
- TMDb API key
- OpenSubtitles account (optional, for subtitle downloads)

## Quick Start

1. Install the package:
```bash
pip install mkv-episode-matcher
```

2. Run on your show directory:
```bash
mkv-match --show-dir "path/to/your/show" --get-subs true
```

## Documentation

Full documentation is available at [https://jsakkos.github.io/mkv-episode-matcher/](https://jsakkos.github.io/mkv-episode-matcher/)

## Directory Structure

MKV Episode Matcher expects your TV shows to be organized as follows:

```
Show Name/
├── Season 1/
│   ├── episode1.mkv
│   ├── episode2.mkv
├── Season 2/
│   ├── episode1.mkv
│   └── episode2.mkv
```

## Reference Subtitle File Structure

Subtitle files that are not automatically downloaded using the `--get-subs` flag should be named as follows:

```

~/.mkv-episode-matcher/cache/data/Show Name/
├── Show Name - S01E01.srt
├── Show Name - S01E02.srt
└── ...
```

On Windows, the cache directory is located at `C:\Users\{username}\.mkv-episode-matcher\cache\data\`

Reference subtitle files should follow this naming pattern:
`{show_name} - S{season:02d}E{episode:02d}.srt`
